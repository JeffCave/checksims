      Do you have a class full of students whose assignments you would like to
      check? Are they in a ZIP file? Perfect. (If you don't, you can <a href='./samples/sampleassignment.zip' alt='Download a sample if you '>download a sample</a>)

     <summary>What file formats are supported?</summary>
     <p>
      MISS was originally designed to help with an introductory python class,
      and was shortly followed by a Javascript class.
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>Python (*.py)</li>
      <li>Javascript (*.js)</li>
      <li>FASTA (*.dna)</li>
      <li>Plain English (*.txt)</li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      Files are tokenized based on their file type (identified by extension)
      which gives them some contextual interpretation.
     </p>
     <h3>Sample Files</h3>
     <dl>
      <dt><a href='./samples/sampleassignment.zip'>Sample Assignments</a></dt>
       <dd>
        A few demo files that I have used in classes. Formatted
        appropriately for student submission, and copied a couple of way.
        Gives some data that will match and some data that will not match.
       </dd>
      <dt><a href='./samples/smallcompares.zip'>Small Compares</a></dt>
       <dd>
        <p>
        Two files with a very small comparison dataset. Suitable for debugging,
        and manually tracing of the algorithm.
        <ol>
         <li><pre><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelacanth">C O E L A C A N T H</a></pre></li>
         <li><pre>  P E L I C A N</pre></li>
        </ol>
        From a bioinformatics class slides I <a href="http://slideplayer.com/slide/5142106/16/images/21/Smith-Waterman-Algorithm.jpg">found online</a>
        </p>
        <p>
         A better dataset would be one that matches multiple times.

        Genome of E.Coli, and Y.Pestarius. Makes for a really big compare,
        and is know to currently break the application.

     <summary>How do you protect my data?</summary>
     <p>
      Very simply: I don't store any.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the primary impetus for the project was to address concerns of
      <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnitin#Reception' title='Turnitin Controversies'>retaliation from students</a>.
      An instructor expressed concerns about transmitting data across
      international boundaries, and having it stored in data-centers not
      in the institutions control. To overcome these objectives, MISS was
      created to work <em>entirely from within the local browser</em>.
     </p>
     <p>
      No data is transferred off you computer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Having said that, I do collect anonymous usage data about your use of
      the site. It is hoped this information will give insight into what new
      features should be implemented.
     </p>
    </details>
    <details>
     <summary>So this program tells me who is cheating?</summary>
     <p><strong>No! Used properly it will tell you who is not cheating.</strong></p>
     <p>
      This program does a blind comparison, but like any creative work,
      software will have common elements to it. Good solutions will be
      independantly discovered. This program does not catch cheaters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rather, this program gives you a place to begin your search. Do you have
      120 papers to grade? You probably only need to investigate about 15%.
      Rather than having to search through hundreds of submissions, this can
      narrow your search down to things that <i>look similar</i>. MISS
      identifies the point where similarity becomes abnormally high for the
      group.
     </p>
     <p>
      In fact, this tool, in its first iteration, found someone suspected of
      cheating to have done nothing wrong.
     </p>
     <p>
      The student had been given a second chance to submit an assignment late
      and had submitted a program that was suspicously similar to a unique
      solution presented by a strong student. Events led to a more intensive
      inspection than was warranted. The fact that computers have no passion
      means they never analyze with bias, and instead showed that the level of
      similarity was high, but normal for the class (and was actually just
      tutoring).
     </p>
    </details>
    <details>
     <summary>Licenses</summary>
     <p>
      The software is free to use.
     </p>
     <p>
      If you find this useful, do feel free to give a leave a
      <a href=''>tip or donation</a> If you use it regularily, consider
      taking out a subscription. If your organization uses it regularily,
      please contact me to discuss enterprise features.
     </p>
     <p>
      The idea of using software to scan large numbers of student assignments
      is not new. In particular
      <a href='https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/'>MOSS</a>
      has served as the direct inspiration for MISS.

     <summary>Browser Support</summary>
     <p>
      Use Google Chrome.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are some issues with browswer support. If you are interested, you
      can view the <a href='browsercheck.html'>browser support page</a> which
      has information on how to turn on and off advanced features.
