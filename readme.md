# Programmatic Similiarity Checker

Based on the work of CheckSim, this project is not a novel
implementation of any similarity checking algorithm. Rather this
project is an attempt to create a simplified, and generic, user
interface to existing algorithms.

Specifically, there are several barriers to entry that exist for
faculty members attempting to ensure academic integrity by using
automated detection algorithms.

1. Complexity
2. Accesibility
3. Legality
4. Reliability

In particular, I would not use this project as a reference since I
cannot speak to the effectiveness of *any* algorithm. This project
does not include any studies into the effectiveness of any particular
algorithm, nor any research into what makes an effective algorithm.

If you are attempting to study this in an effort to avoid being
identified as having your work be similar to someone else's, I
suggest the following:
